​​My name is Michael and I am based in Clinton Township, MI. I found my passion for learning computer sciences at the age of 23 and went to college at age 25. Since then, I have dedicated countless hours to learning and expanding this passion.

​​In my professional career, I started out as a Java developer working at Oakland University. While working there, the team decided to implement ReactJS and this sparked my interest in frontend development. I spent the next few years learning JavaScript, NodeJS, ReactJS, and CSS while continuing to work as a backend developer. Now, I am shifting my focus more towards the front-end and specializing in ReactJS.

​​When I am not coding, I enjoy [playing guitar](https://soundcloud.com/mikefrieze88/something-i-made-in-2016), watching lectures on Wondrium, playing PC games, reading, and spending time with [my partner](https://kaylafoister.weebly.com/) (since 2010).
