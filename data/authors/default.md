## About me

I'm Michael, a 33-year-old freelance developer based in Michigan.

I found my passion for learning computer sciences at the age of 25 when I started college. Since then, I have dedicated countless hours to learning and expanding this passion. Also, I've worked alongside other developers who have raised my standards for what's expected of any web application.

Through my studies and experience, I've gained a solid understanding of web development concepts and learned to apply these concepts to real-world scenarios and applications. Furthermore, I've had the opportunity to create applications that are not only enjoyable to use, but are written in code that's maintainable and easy to understand.

​​In my professional career, I started out as a Java developer working at Oakland University. While working there, the team decided to implement React and this sparked my interest in front-end development. I spent the next few years learning JavaScript, Node.js, React, and CSS while continuing to work as a back-end developer. Now, I mainly focus on the front end and specialize in React.

​​When I am not coding, I enjoy [playing guitar](https://soundcloud.com/mikefrieze88/something-i-made-in-2016), watching lectures on Wondrium, playing PC games, reading, and spending time with [my partner](https://kaylafoister.weebly.com/) (since 2010).
