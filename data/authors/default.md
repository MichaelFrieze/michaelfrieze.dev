## About this site

Welcome to my home on the internet. This site functions as a portfolio, a place to share code, and my thoughts on software development.

This site was built with Next.js using [this template](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog). Most of the inspiration came from [Lee Robsinson](https://leerob.io/) and [Kent C. Dodds](https://kentcdodds.com/). Eventually I will rebuild this site with [Remix](https://remix.run/).

## About me

​​My name is Michael and I am based in Clinton Township, MI. I found my passion for learning computer sciences at the age of 23 and went to college at age 25. Since then, I have dedicated countless hours to learning and expanding this passion.

​​In my professional career, I started out as a Java developer working at Oakland University. While working there, the team decided to implement React and this sparked my interest in front-end development. I spent the next few years learning JavaScript, Node.js, React, and CSS while continuing to work as a back-end developer. Now, I am shifting my focus more towards the front end and specializing in React.

​​When I am not coding, I enjoy [playing guitar](https://soundcloud.com/mikefrieze88/something-i-made-in-2016), watching lectures on Wondrium, playing PC games, reading, and spending time with [my partner](https://kaylafoister.weebly.com/) (since 2010).
